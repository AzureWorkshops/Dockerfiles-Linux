## Setup Requirements
The following workshop will require that you use a Telnet/SSH client in order to connect to a remote machine.  If you do not have a SSH client, then [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) will work fine. Depending on your environment, download the executable in a standalone file (.EXE) or an installable package (.MSI), either in a 32-bit or 64-bit.

## Additional Requirements
For the following workshop, you will need a subscription (trial or paid) to Microsoft Azure.  Please see the [next](./01_Azure_Registration.md) page for how to create a trial subscription, if necessary.
